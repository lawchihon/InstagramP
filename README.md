# Project - InstagramP

InstagramP is a simulated Instagram app sharing pictures by using [Parse API](http://parseplatform.org).

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication
- [X] User can log in and log out of his or her account
- [X] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts
- [X] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram"
- [X] User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Show the username and creation time for each post
- [X] After the user submits a new post, show a progress HUD while the post is being uploaded to Parse.
- [ ] User Profiles:
   - [ ] Allow the logged in user to add a profile photo
   - [ ] Display the profile photo with each post
   - [ ] Tapping on a post's username or profile photo goes to that user's profile page

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] User can change the photo before it get posted
- [X] The posted photo will be updated in timeline
- [X] Sign up will automatically log in if successful

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. What will be the best way to resize the image?
2. Should we do user email check? How?
